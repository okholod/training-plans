# Training Plans

This repository contains a set of documents that describe training paths for preparing specialist for future projects.

## Base Skills
We consider useful for all (junior) developers joining the team to start with the introductory path. It's intended to re-vive their knowledge and skills in several most common areas.
* [Introductory Path](introductory.md)

## Data Science and AI
The following paths are related to **Data Science and AI** areas. We tried to cover several most popular 'profiles' here. For sure, these materials cannot be considered as generic ones, since they are based both on the technology stack the team uses and skills in demand by our customers.
* [Data Engineer / Scala](de-scala.md)
* [Data Scientist / Python](ds-python.md)
* [Machine Learning Engineer / Python](mle-python.md)

## Web Development
We suggest the next preparation path for JavaScript developers.
* [Javascript developer](js.md)

And some really useful links on different related technologies:
* [Awesome JS links](awesome-js.md)
* [Awesome CSS links](awesome-css.md)
* [Awesome NodeJS links](awesome-nodejs.md)
